# MSPACMan

This Python package provides tools to estimate **phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)** in neural time series.

The development of this project is strongly influenced by a couple of existing PAC analysis tools, [pacpy](https://github.com/voytekresearch/pacpy) and [pactools](https://github.com/pactools/pactools).
However, MSPACMan is developed due to the need for implementing PAC analysis to real-time applications, it is thus by no means a replacement of the existing tools.

The link to the paper will be provided here once the paper is accepted.
